    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage song requests submitted by students in a Karaoke Queue application. It prioritizes authorization independence and efficient data retrieval while adhering to the specified design principles. Since authentication includes anonymous users, a simplified path-based ownership model is used where song requests are created under the user's document.\n\n1.  **Authorization Independence**: Each `SongRequest` document is stored under the student's document (`/students/{studentId}/song_requests/{songRequestId}`). This structure enforces path-based ownership, ensuring that only the student can create, update, or delete their song requests without needing to check parent document data.\n2.  **Structural Segregation**: Song requests are segregated by student under the `/students/{studentId}/song_requests` collection, ensuring homogeneous security requirements for each request within a student's context.\n3.  **Access Modeling**: Path-based ownership (`/students/{studentId}/song_requests/{songRequestId}`) is used.  Admins can bypass these rules, if necessary, by using separate collections (not shown here).\n4. **QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n    *   Students can `list` song requests under their document. This design allows for secure `list` operations based on the user id.\n    *   Admin `list` operations are possible by bypassing ownership rules. (not shown here)."
