/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control.
 * User data is isolated, and administrative functions are carefully guarded.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores individual student profiles, accessible only to the owner (the student themselves) and admins.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests. Students can create requests with their studentId, while admins can manage (update, delete) any request.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs. Only admins can read these logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read their own profile data.
 * - Song requests are stored in a flat collection to facilitate admin management and queue ordering.
 * - Only admins are permitted to view audit logs.
 * - Data validation during writes is limited to critical relational fields to maintain flexibility during prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests include the `studentId` to easily verify the submitter.
