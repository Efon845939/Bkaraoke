/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student profiles
 *              and allows public read access to song requests, with owner-only writes.
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, accessible only to the student themselves.
 *   - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests, publicly readable, but with restricted write access.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Students can only read/write their own profile data.
 *   - Song requests are publicly readable to allow for display and voting.
 *   - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete song requests, and they must own the request.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - The `SongRequest` entity has a `studentId` field that links it to the `Student` entity,
 *     allowing us to verify ownership without additional `get()` calls.
