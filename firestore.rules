/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Karaoke App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces role-based access control, with owners, admins, and students having different levels of access.
 * Owners have full access, admins have read-only access to most data, and students can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student and admin profiles, where {studentId} matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests. Each document contains a studentId field indicating the requester.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs, accessible only to owners for reading and all signed-in users for creating.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Owners and admins can read all student profiles, while students can only read/update their own profile.
 * - Song requests can be read/modified by owners, read by admins, and read/modified by the requesting student.
 * - Audit logs can only be read by owners but any logged in user can create them.
 * - Listing is allowed for students and song_requests for the appropriate roles.
 * - No schema validation is performed in this prototype.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `song_requests` documents denormalize the `studentId` to allow security rules to quickly check ownership without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Separate collections are used for students, song requests, and audit logs to simplify access control and querying.
