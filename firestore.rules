/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Karaoke Song Request App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a mixed security model. Students can only manage their own profile data,
 * while song requests are publicly readable but only writable by authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profile information, where {studentId} is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests, with no user-specific ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read/write their own student document.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable to facilitate display in the app.
 * - Song requests can be created, updated, or deleted only by authenticated users.
 * - No user listing is allowed for privacy and security.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A (No denormalization is explicitly required by the data model).
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  N/A (No structural segregation is explicitly required by the data model).
