/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke Owner App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces role-based access control for students and admins. Students can only manage their own profiles and create song requests. Admins have read-only access to all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student and admin profiles. The 'studentId' must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores a chronological log of all significant actions taken in the application.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can create their own profile, but admins cannot create student profiles directly via Firestore. New student profiles are only created via authentication.
 * - Students can create song requests.
 * - No user listing is allowed to protect privacy.
 * - The audit_logs collection is only readable by admins.
