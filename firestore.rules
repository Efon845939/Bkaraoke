/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict role-based access control model for students and admins.
 * Students can manage their own profiles, while admins have broader access to song requests and audit logs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student and admin profile data.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores a chronological log of actions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Admins have read access to song requests and audit logs, but write access is restricted.
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `Student` entity includes a `role` field (either "student" or "admin") which simplifies
 * role-based authorization checks in the rules.
