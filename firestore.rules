/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Karaoke Request App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for student profiles, allowing students to manage their own profile data.
 * Song requests are managed in a public collection, with read access for all and owner-only write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profile data, with {studentId} matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable, but only the creator can modify or delete them.
 * - User listing is disabled for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - SongRequest documents include a `studentId` field, denormalizing the student's ID for simpler ownership checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Student profiles are stored in a user-specific collection (/students/{studentId}), while song requests are stored in a top-level public collection (/song_requests/{songRequestId}).
