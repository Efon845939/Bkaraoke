/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with ownership for song requests.
 * All data is stored in top-level collections: /students (participants), /song_requests, and /audit_logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Participants can only read, create, update their own song requests.
 *  - Listing all song requests is only allowed for authenticated users with 'admin' role.
 *  - Participants can only read their own profile.
 *  - Auditing is writeable by Admin only.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - SongRequest documents contain a `participantId` field to simplify ownership checks, avoiding the need for additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Uses top-level collections for public data (song_requests), and a user collection (students) for private data.
