/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke Owner App Prototype
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model. Students can manage their own profiles and submit song requests.
 * Admins have read-only access to all song requests and audit logs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student and admin profiles. The `studentId` matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read/write their own profile data.
 * - Admins cannot create, update, or delete any data, but can list song requests and audit logs.
 * - Denormalization is used to store the student's name on song requests.
 * - Public listing of audit logs is disallowed.
