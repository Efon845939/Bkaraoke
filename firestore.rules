/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student profiles,
 * allowing students to only access their own profile data. Song requests are
 * stored in a top-level collection and are publicly readable but only
 * modifiable by authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores individual student profiles, where {studentId}
 *   matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable to allow for display in the app.
 * - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete song requests.
 *   The `studentId` on creation must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - Listing of all students is denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `SongRequest` entity includes the `studentId` field. This design avoids
 * the need for costly `get()` operations to determine the student's ID.
