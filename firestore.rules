/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for student profiles and allows admins/publishers to manage song requests.
 * @data_structure
 *   - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, where {studentId} is the Firebase Auth UID.
 *   - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Students can only read/write their own profile data.
 *   - Song requests are managed by admins/publishers, who can create, read, update, and delete them. Students cannot directly modify song requests.
 *   - Denormalization: The `studentName` is denormalized on the SongRequest to avoid needing to read the Student document during song request management.
