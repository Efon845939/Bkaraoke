/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student profiles
 * and allows public read access to song requests, but restricts modifications to authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, with studentId matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable, but only authenticated users can create, update, or delete them.
 * - The 'studentId' field in the SongRequest MUST match the authenticated user's UID on creation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests include a 'studentId' field, denormalizing the user relationship to simplify authorization rules and prevent the need for costly `get()` calls.
