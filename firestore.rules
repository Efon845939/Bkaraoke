/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-based access control for student profiles
 * and role-based authorization for administrative tasks. It also allows public read
 * access to song requests, with owner-only writes. All writes are restricted to
 * authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student and admin profiles, with 'studentId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs of actions performed in the system.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read/write their own profile data. Admins are not yet implemented.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable but only writable by authenticated users who set a correct `studentId`.
 * - Audit logs are only writeable, intended for server-side logging.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'SongRequest' entity requires the 'studentId' field to match the authenticated user's UID for writes.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - There is no structural segregation in this data model.
