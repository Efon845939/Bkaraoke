/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model, distinguishing between 'student' and 'admin' roles.
 * Students can only read their own profiles. Admins have more elevated permissions.
 * Public listing of users (students) is disallowed.
 * All write operations are carefully validated to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read (get) their own profile. Listing all students is disallowed.
 * - Song requests are stored in a single top-level collection to facilitate admin management and global ordering.
 * - Audit logs can only be written by authenticated users and are not readable by clients.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `SongRequest` entity denormalizes `studentName` and `studentId` directly onto the document to avoid needing to query the `students` collection for every request.
