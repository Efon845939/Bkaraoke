/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student profiles,
 * allowing only authenticated users to read and write their own profiles.
 * Song requests are publicly readable but can only be created with a valid studentId
 * and updated/deleted by the owner (creator) of that request.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, where {studentId} matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students collection is not listable, as listing user IDs can be a privacy concern.
 * - Public read access for song requests allows for a shared karaoke queue visible to everyone.
 * - Students can only create their own profile, not modify or delete.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests denormalize studentName and studentId directly onto the document for simpler rules.
