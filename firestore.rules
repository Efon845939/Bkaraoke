/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Karaoke Request App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model, balancing open access for song requests with strict owner-only access for user profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests; publicly readable, but writeable only with ownership validation.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Logs of actions, writeable only by administrators.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - The 'song_requests' collection is publicly readable for all users, signed in or not. Writes are restricted via ownership.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
