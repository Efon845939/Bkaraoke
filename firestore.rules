/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership and role-based access control.
 * Students can only manage their own profiles, while admins have broader access.
 * Song requests are publicly readable but only modifiable by authorized users.
 * Audit logs are write-only for server-side functions to ensure integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests in a single collection.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read/write their own student document. Admins have no special access to these profiles.
 * - Song requests are readable by everyone, but can only be created by students and updated/deleted by admins.
 * - Audit logs can only be created by server-side functions, not by clients.
 * - No user listing is allowed for the /students collection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `SongRequest` entity denormalizes the `studentName` to avoid needing to query the `students` collection for display purposes. The `studentId` is used to relate the song request to the student.
