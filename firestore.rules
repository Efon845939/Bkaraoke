/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model for a karaoke song request application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{participantId}: Stores participant and admin profiles.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores audit logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Participants can only read their own song requests.
 * - Admins and Owners have full read/write access to song requests.
 * - Only authenticated users can create song requests.
 * - Audit logs can only be created by trusted server environments.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests contain a `participantId` field to quickly check ownership.
