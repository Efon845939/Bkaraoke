/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership and public-read with restricted-write access patterns.
 * Student profiles are secured using an ownership model, while song requests are publicly readable but require authentication for creation and owner-validation for modification or deletion.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores individual student profiles, with studentId matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable to allow for display and queuing.
 * - Only authenticated users can create song requests, ensuring accountability.
 * - Only the original submitter can modify or delete a song request.

     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.
