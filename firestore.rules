/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Song Request application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode, prioritizing developer velocity.  It focuses on broad accessibility
 * to enable rapid iteration.  As such, read and write access to song requests is open to all authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All song requests are stored in the `/song_requests/{songRequestId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user-specific ownership: All authenticated users can read and write any song request.
 * - No schema validation: Data validation is deferred to the application layer for faster prototyping.
