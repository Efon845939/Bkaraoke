/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Karaoke App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for song requests and participant profiles,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can create, modify, or delete their own song requests.
 * Admin users can manage all song requests.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores participant and admin profiles, using the Firebase Auth UID as the document ID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests, with a denormalized `studentId` field for ownership checks.
 * - /audit_logs/{logId}: Stores a chronological log of all significant actions taken in the application.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing all documents in the `song_requests` collection is disallowed to prevent excessive data retrieval. Use queries instead.
 * - Only authenticated users can create song requests.
 * - Song requests can only be modified or deleted by the original submitter or an admin.
 * - Participant profiles can only be created, updated, or deleted by themselves or an admin.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests store the `studentId` to avoid needing to perform additional reads to verify ownership.
 * - Audit logs store `actorId` and `actorName` for ease of auditing and display.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - There is no need for structural segregation in this app.
