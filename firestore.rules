/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Song Request App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for student profiles, allowing students to only manage their own profiles.
 * Song requests are stored in a single top-level collection.  Write access to song requests is open, but should be restricted to authenticated users only to prevent abuse (e.g., spam).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profile information, where {studentId} matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Listing students is disallowed to prevent unauthorized enumeration of user accounts.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable to allow for display of the song queue, but writes should be restricted to authenticated users.
 * - No data schema validation is performed beyond authorization checks, supporting rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `studentId` in the `/students/{studentId}` path matches the `id` field within the student document, ensuring ownership.
