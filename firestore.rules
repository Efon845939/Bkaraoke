/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for student profiles and allows authenticated users to create song requests.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, where studentId matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Only authenticated users can create song requests.
 * - Song requests can be read by anyone, allowing for a public queue.
 * - Song requests can only be updated or deleted by the user who created them.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests have a `studentId` field, which allows rules to quickly verify the owner of the request.
