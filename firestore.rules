/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Song Request App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model. Students can create their profiles.
 * Song requests are managed centrally, with create permissions given to both students and admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, with the 'studentId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores all song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only create their own profile. They can't edit or delete it.
 * - Anyone can read song requests.
 * - Both students and admins can create song requests.
 * - Only admins can update or delete song requests.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests denormalize the student's ID and name to allow for easier display and querying without requiring additional reads.
