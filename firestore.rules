/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for student profiles
 * and allows public read access to song requests while restricting write access to authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, where {studentId} is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /song_requests/{songRequestId}: Stores song requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Song requests are publicly readable but only writable by authenticated users if ownership is established.
 * - Listing of students is allowed only for authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Song requests do not contain explicit student profile information.
